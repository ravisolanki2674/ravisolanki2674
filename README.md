Project Details
1. Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning
This segment of our project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to predict stock prices. We employ advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future price movements. Our goal is to develop accurate models that assist investors in making informed decisions in the stock market.

2. Phishing Domain Detection
Our team, led by Ravi Solanki, participated in the Smart Hackathon where we developed a Phishing Domain Detection system. We're proud to announce that we secured the 3rd position in our department. The project involved the application of machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify and classify phishing domains, thereby enhancing cybersecurity measures.

3. Impact of Video Games on Problem Solving Skills
In this research endeavor, we delve into the fascinating area of video games and their impact on problem-solving skills. Through empirical studies and data analysis, we aim to understand how engagement with video games correlates with the development of problem-solving abilities. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on the effects of technology on cognitive functions.
